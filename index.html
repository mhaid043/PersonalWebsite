            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Mostafa Haidari, and I am an undergraduate student in the
                <a href="https://carleton.ca/scs/">School of Computer Science</a> at
                <a href="https://carleton.ca">Carleton University</a>.
                I have experience developing software using Python, Java, C#, and SQL, 
                with a focus on writing clear, maintainable code 
                and applying basic database queries for data organization and retrieval. 
                My academic and project work has also introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                as well as system-level concepts such as file I/O, memory management, and concurrency.
                In addition to my technical background, 
                I have hands-on experience providing technical support and documentation in IT environments, 
                assisting users with hardware setup, troubleshooting, and data recovery. 
                I value clear communication and effective teamwork, 
                and I am comfortable supporting non-technical users in customer-facing roles. 
                I am fluent in English, Farsi, 
                and Turkish and motivated to continue developing both my technical and professional skills.
